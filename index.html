            <p>Looking for a unicorn in photography? I am a professional photographer with an eye for the beautiful. Over the last few years, I focused my lens on those
                beautiful creatures called "horses" as I photograph horse-racing around the U.S. Take a look at my work and
                say hello using the contact link below if you would like me to photograph your event.</p><br>

                    <p>After years of working in the Insurance sector, I was able to retire and pursue my love of photography.
                        I love many aspects of photography, but in the last several years, my friends turned me on to horse-racing events. I now travel the
                        U.S. photographing racing events and couldn't be happier. My work is published in magazines and other media. 
                        I love traveling and searching for the unicorn.
