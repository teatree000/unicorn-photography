                    <p>Looking for the Unicorn in photography? I am a professional photographer with an eye for the beautiful. Recently, I have focused my lens on those
                         beautiful creatures called horses. Over the last 12 months I have been hired to photograph at horse-racing events around the U.S. Take a look at what I have 
                         been up to. If you like what you see, say hello to me using the contact link at the bottom of this page</p><br>
